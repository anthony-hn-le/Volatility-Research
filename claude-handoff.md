# Claude Handoff: Volatility Forecasting Research

**Project:** Machine Learning and Traditional Econometrics for Volatility Forecasting  
**Duration:** 10-week summer research (May 2026)  
**Supervisor:** Emily Marshall & Tyler Wake (Denison Economics)  
**Goal:** Compare ML models vs. econometric benchmarks for equity volatility prediction + test economic value in portfolios  

---

## 📋 Current Status

**Phase:** Week 10 – Documentation & Manuscript (complete)  
**Date:** July 8, 2026  
**Progress:** All 10 weeks of the original plan are complete — data, all 9 models
(econometric/ML/hybrid), statistical evaluation (incl. residual diagnostics and
Diebold-Mariano/Model Confidence Set), the economic backtest, Week 9 robustness battery, and
the full manuscript + symposium poster.

### Completed Work
- ✅ Data pipeline for all 18 assets (`src/data.py`), features (`src/features.py`)
- ✅ GARCH(1,1), EGARCH(1,1), GJR-GARCH(1,1), HAR-RV walk-forward (`notebooks/02_garch_baseline.ipynb`)
- ✅ Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM, GARCH-RF, GARCH-XGBoost walk-forward (`notebooks/03_ml_models.ipynb`)
- ✅ Residual diagnostics (Ljung-Box, ACF, QQ) for all 9 models — Figures 8/8b
- ✅ Diebold-Mariano + Model Confidence Set across all 9 models (`src/evaluation.py`,
  `results/model_confidence_set.csv`, `results/diebold_mariano_vs_garch.csv`)
- ✅ Four portfolio strategies incl. VRP (`src/backtest.py`) run against all 9 models'
  forecasts — `notebooks/04_results.ipynb`, `results/portfolio_performance.csv`, Figures 9a/9b
- ✅ Week 9 robustness: cross-asset RMSE validation (Fig. 10a), cost/leverage sensitivity
  (Fig. 10b), pre/post-2022 sub-period stability, cost-benefit synthesis
  (`results/cross_asset_rmse_h1.csv`, `sensitivity_analysis.csv`, `stability_by_period.csv`,
  `cost_benefit_synthesis.csv`)
- ✅ Full manuscript (`notebooks/05_manuscript.ipynb`, ~5,450 words) and Fall Symposium poster
  (HTML artifact)

### Active Tasks (Use TaskUpdate to track)
Project complete per the original 10-week plan. Any further work (e.g. multi-horizon ML
architecture, intraday RV proxy, fully specified VRP options simulation — see manuscript
Section 4 Limitations) would be a new phase, not a continuation of this plan.

## 🎯 Research Questions

1. **Statistical Accuracy:** Do ML and hybrid models significantly reduce out-of-sample forecast errors (RMSE, QLIKE) vs. parametric benchmarks?
2. **Economic Utility:** Does superior statistical accuracy translate into higher risk-adjusted returns in portfolio applications?
3. **Regime Resilience:** How do models perform during market stress vs. calm periods?

---

## 📊 Data Specification

### Assets (18 Total)
**Indices (3):**
- SPY (S&P 500)

- Consumer: AMZN, WMT, HD
- Energy/Industrials: XOM, CVX, CAT

### Time Period
- **In-sample (training):** Jan 2010 – Dec 2017 (8 years)
- **Out-of-sample (forecast/backtest):** Jan 2018 – Dec 2025 (8 years)
- **Total:** ~4,000 observations per asset (daily)

### Data Sources
| Source | Primary Use | Coverage | Notes |
|--------|------------|----------|-------|
| **yfinance** | Daily prices, primary | All 18 assets, 2010-2025 | Fast, reliable, free |

### Key Metrics to Compute
- **Realized Volatility (RV):** 21-day rolling standard deviation of daily returns, annualized
- **Volatility Regimes:** Low (<15%), Medium (15–25%), High (>25%)
- **Machine Learning Features:** ~40–50 predictors across 5 categories (see Feature Engineering below)

## 🏗️ Architectural Decisions

### Data Pipeline
```
Raw Data (yfinance) 
    ↓
Data Cleaning & Validation
    ↓
Feature Engineering (40-50 predictors)
    ↓
Walk-Forward Train/Test Splits
    ↓
Model Training & Forecasting
```

### Walk-Forward Validation Framework
- **Initial training window:** Jan 2010 – Dec 2017
- **Refit frequency:** Monthly (end of each month)
- **Forecast horizon:** 1-day, 5-day, 20-day ahead
- **Test period:** Jan 2018 – Dec 2025 (96 monthly refits)
- **Procedure:** Expanding window (retrain on all data to date, not rolling)

### Model Comparison Structure
Eight models to compare in three categories:

**Traditional Econometric (3):**
1. GARCH(1,1) – baseline
2. EGARCH(1,1) – leverage effects
3. GJR-GARCH(1,1) – threshold asymmetry

**Machine Learning (3):**
4. Random Forest (500–1,000 trees)
5. XGBoost (with early stopping)
6. LSTM (2–3 layers, 64–128 units, dropout 0.2–0.3)

**Hybrid (2):**
7. GARCH-RF (GARCH fitted values + residuals → Random Forest)
8. GARCH-XGBoost (GARCH fitted values + residuals → XGBoost)

### Feature Engineering Categories (40–50 predictors)

| Category | Features | Count |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **Historical Volatility** | Lagged RV (1,2,3,5,10,20,60d), rolling avgs, momentum | ~8 |
| **Return Dynamics** | Lagged returns, abs returns, rolling skew/kurtosis, extremes | ~8 |
| **Market Microstructure** | High-low range, volume (scaled), gap frequency, bid-ask spread proxy | ~6 |
| **Market-Wide Info** | VIX level/change, S&P 500 indicators, market breadth | ~5 |
| **Calendar Effects** | Day-of-week, month-of-year, post-FOMC dummies | ~3–5 |
| **Redundancy Filtering** | Remove features with |correlation| > 0.95 | Applied after construction |

### Evaluation Metrics

**Statistical (accuracy):**
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- QLIKE (Quasi-Likelihood, volatility-specific)
- Directional Accuracy (sign prediction)
- Model Confidence Set (Hansen & Lunde 2006)

**Economic (portfolio performance):**
- Sharpe Ratio
- Sortino Ratio
- Maximum Drawdown
- Calmar Ratio
- Transaction Cost Drag

### Portfolio Strategies (4)
1. **Volatility-Timing:** Dynamic SPY/SHY allocation targeting 15% risk; monthly rebalance; $5/trade costs
2. **Risk-Parity:** 15-stock portfolio weighted inversely by forecasted vol; monthly rebalance; turnover constraints
3. **Regime-Based Allocation:** Discrete equity-bond shift across low/medium/high vol regimes; less frequent trading
4. **VRP (Variance Risk Premium):** Delta-neutral short-straddle proxy exploiting the spread between
   implied vol (VIX) and each model's forecast; monthly rebalance; $5/trade costs (`src/backtest.py:vrp_strategy`)

## 🚀 Next Immediate Actions (What to do in Claude Code)

### Session 1: Data Foundation
```python
# 1. Collect & validate data
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd

assets = ['SPY', 'QQQ', 'IWM', 'AAPL', 'MSFT', 'NVDA', 'JPM', 'GS', 'BAC', 
          'JNJ', 'UNH', 'PFE', 'AMZN', 'WMT', 'HD', 'XOM', 'CVX', 'CAT']

for ticker in assets:
    df = yf.download(ticker, start='2010-01-01', end='2025-12-31', progress=False)
    df.to_csv(f'data/raw/{ticker}_daily.csv')

# 2. Compute realized volatility
for ticker in assets:
    df = pd.read_csv(f'data/raw/{ticker}_daily.csv', index_col=0, parse_dates=True)
    df['returns'] = df['Adj Close'].pct_change()
    df['rv_21d'] = df['returns'].rolling(21).std() * np.sqrt(252) * 100  # Annualized %
    df.to_csv(f'data/processed/{ticker}_with_rv.csv')

# 3. Create merged dataset for ML
# (Combine all 18 assets into one feature matrix)
```

### Session 2: Baseline GARCH Model
```python
# Implement walk-forward GARCH(1,1)
# Train on 2010-2017, forecast Jan 2018 onward
# Monthly refitting

from arch import arch_model
import numpy as np

def garch_forecast(returns, n_forecast=20):
    model = arch_model(returns, vol='Garch', p=1, q=1)
    res = model.fit(disp='off')
    forecast = res.forecast(horizon=n_forecast)
    return forecast.variance.values[-1, :]  # Next n_forecast days
```

### Session 3: Feature Engineering
```python
# Construct 40-50 predictors
# Lagged volatility, returns, skew, kurtosis, VIX, market breadth, etc.
# Use data.py and features.py modules

def engineer_features(df, target_col='rv_21d'):
    """
    Create lagged RV, returns, and market features.
    Apply correlation filtering & standardization.
    """
    pass  # Implement in src/features.py
```
